## Full example of Power BI (2020 Olympic Medals data)
Power BI cannot be considered as one software as it is a combination of three different tools as follows:
1) Power Query
2) Power Pivot
3) Power BI Visuals

In this project, implemented a small project using these three layers play together to create beautiful insights from your raw data with a FULL length example.
