#### Full example of Power BI (3 layers)
Power BI cannot be considered as one software as it is a combination of three different tools as follows:
1) Power Query (PQ)
  Engine or the software that let you to connect the data source, fetch the data and change anything in the data (transform) if needed.
2) Power Pivot (PP)
   Perform the calculations, and the language that used to calculate is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) 
3) Power BI Visuals
   Once the calculations are done the insights are visualization in Power Bi visual layer for example make the graphs, column charts etc.

In this project, implemented a small project using these three layers play together to create beautiful insights from your raw data with a FULL length example.
