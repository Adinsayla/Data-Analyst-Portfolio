# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

This repository is mainly for projects I have done to showcase my skills related to data analysis tool using example datasets from internet. 

This includes project related to SQL, Power BI, Excel and cover entire process of Data Analysis including Data cleaning, Modeling, Analysis and Visualization. To work online data analyst datasets procided me a way to showcase my skills as a data analyst 
by cleaning and organizing data,
unveil the patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly visualize the critical findings. I am developing proficiency
in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , 
seaborn thest basic libraries. 


### [SQL for MOVEHOME Database](https://github.com/Adinsayla/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL%20MOVEHOME%20Database)
It is an academic project, and I worked on it as part of my assessment.

The scenario is as follows:

MOVEHOME is a consortium of independent estate agents in the UK, functioning as a unified online platform for marketing and advertising properties for sale and rent. Its primary objective is to connect property owners/landlords with potential buyers and tenants.

MOVEHOME customers include landlords, prospective buyers, and tenants. Landlords register their properties for sale or rent through individual estate agents. When a customer expresses interest in viewing a property, their details are forwarded to the relevant estate agent, who coordinates the viewing with the landlord. It is the responsibility of the respective local branch of the estate agent to liaise with the landlord and potential buyers or tenants to confirm the viewing.

For each estate agent, the system stores information about their branch offices, branch staff, and the properties marketed by each estate agent/local branch. Additionally, the system records data regarding properties sold and rented out. Estate agent details include name, headquarters, registered address, website, and contact information. For estate agent staff, the system maintains their ID, name, address, contact details, and personal information. Each branch is assigned a unique code, and the system stores its address, contact details, and manager's information.

Upon customer registration with MOVEHOME, the system assigns a unique code and records their name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details. When a property is listed for marketing, the system assigns a unique ID and records its address, location, description, accommodation details (room sizes and descriptions), rental demand or asking price, type, number of rooms, etc.

For property viewings, the system logs details about the customer viewing the property, the date and time of the viewing, and any comments made by the customer during or after the visit. In the case of property sales transactions facilitated by MOVEHOME, the system records information about the customer purchasing the property, including the selling price, stamp duty, and commission paid. Similarly, for rental transactions, the system records information about the rented property, monthly rent, advance payment, commission, landlord and tenant details, commencement and termination dates of the tenancy.
